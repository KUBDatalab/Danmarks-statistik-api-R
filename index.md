Data Carpentryâ€™s aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, 
and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in 
less time, and with less pain. The lessons below were designed for 
those interested in working with data in R.

This is an introduction to harvesting data from the Statistics Denmark, using 
R. It is designed for participants with a working knowledge of R, at least 
on the level of our introductory course 
(R for absolute beginners)[https://kubdatalab.github.io/beginning-R/].

These lessons can be taught in 2 hours. They start with a short refresher of
R, introduces what an API is, and how to get data from it, and finishes with
calculating summary statistics from that data. A brief introduction to plotting 
rounds of the course.

This site is a work in progress.
