## What are data frames and tibbles?

Data frames are the _de facto_ data structure for tabular data in `R`, and what
we use for data processing, statistics, and plotting.


![A 3 by 3 data frame with columns showing numeric, character and logical values.](../fig/data-frame.svg)

Data frames can be created by hand, but most commonly they are generated by the
functions `read_csv()` or `read_table()`; in other words, when importing
spreadsheets from your hard drive (or the web). We will now demonstrate how to
import tabular data using `read_csv()`.



## Importing data

You are going load the data in R's memory using the function `read_csv()`
from the **`readr`** package, which is part of the **`tidyverse`**; learn
more about the **`tidyverse`** collection of packages
[here](https://www.tidyverse.org/).
**`readr`** gets installed as part as the **`tidyverse`** installation.
When you load  the **`tidyverse`** (`library(tidyverse)`), the core packages
(the packages used in most data analyses) get loaded, including **`readr`**.



~~~
library(tidyverse)

interviews <- read_csv("../data/SAFI_clean.csv", na = "NULL")
~~~
{: .language-r}


The statement in the code above creates a data frame but doesn't output
any data because, as you might recall, assignments (`<-`) don't display
anything. (Note, however, that `read_csv` may show informational
text about the data frame that is created.) If we want to check that our data
has been loaded, we can see the contents of the data frame by typing its name:
`interviews` in the console.


~~~
interviews
## Try also
## view(interviews)
## head(interviews)
~~~
{: .language-r}

Note that `read_csv()` actually loads the data as a tibble.
A tibble is an extension of `R` data frames used by the **`tidyverse`**. When
the data is read using `read_csv()`, it is stored in an object of class 
`tbl_df`, `tbl`,  and `data.frame`. You can see the class of an object with


~~~
class(interviews)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "spec_tbl_df" "tbl_df"      "tbl"         "data.frame" 
~~~
{: .output}

As a `tibble`, the type of data included in each column is listed in an
abbreviated fashion below the column names. For instance, here `key_ID` is a
column of floating point numbers (abbreviated `<dbl>` for the word 'double'),
`village` is a column of characters (`<chr>`) and the `interview_date` is a 
column in the "date and time" format (`<dkttm>`).

## Inspecting data frames

Size:  

* `dim(interviews)` - returns a vector with the number of rows as the first
element, and the number of columns as the second element (the **dim**ensions of
the object)
* `nrow(interviews)` - returns the number of rows
* `ncol(interviews)` - returns the number of columns

Content: 

* `head(interviews)` - shows the first 6 rows
* `tail(interviews)` - shows the last 6 rows

Names: 

* `names(interviews)` - returns the column names (synonym of `colnames()` for
`data.frame` objects)

Summary:  

* `str(interviews)` - structure of the object and information about the class,
length and content of each column
* `summary(interviews)` - summary statistics for each column
* `glimpse(interviews)` - returns the number of columns and rows of the tibble,
the names and class of each column, and previews as many values will fit on the
screen. Unlike the other inspecting functions listed above, `glimpse()` is not a
"base R" function so you need to have the `dplyr` or `tibble` packages loaded to
be able to execute it.

Note: most of these functions are "generic." They can be used on other types of
objects besides data frames or tibbles.


## Indexing and subsetting data frames

Our `interviews` data frame has rows and columns (it has 2 dimensions).
In practice, we may not need the entire data frame; for instance, we may only
be interested in a subset of the observations (the rows) or a particular set
of variables (the columns). If we want to
extract some specific data from it, we need to specify the "coordinates" we
want from it. Row numbers come first, followed by column numbers.

> ## Tip
> Indexing a `tibble` with `[` always results in a `tibble`.
> However, note this is not true in general for data frames, so be careful!
> Different ways of specifying these coordinates can lead to results with
> different classes. This is covered in the Software Carpentry lesson
> [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/).

`:` is a special function that creates numeric vectors of integers in increasing
or decreasing order, test `1:10` and `10:1` for instance.

`tibble`s can be subset by calling indices (as shown previously), but also by
calling their column names directly:


~~~
interviews["village"]       # Result is a tibble

interviews[, "village"]     # Result is a tibble

interviews[["village"]]     # Result is a vector

interviews$village          # Result is a vector
~~~
{: .language-r}

In RStudio, you can use the autocompletion feature to get the full and correct
names of the columns.



## Factors

R has a special data class, called factor, to deal with categorical data that
you may encounter when creating plots or doing statistical analyses. Factors are
very useful and actually contribute to making R particularly well suited to
working with data. So we are going to spend a little time introducing them.

Factors represent categorical data. They are stored as integers associated with
labels and they can be ordered (ordinal) or unordered (nominal). Factors
create a structured  relation between the different levels (values) of a
categorical variable, such as days of the week or responses to a question in
a survey. This can make it easier to see how one element relates to the
other elements in a column. While factors look (and often behave) like
character vectors, they are actually treated as integer vectors by `R`. So
you need to be very careful when treating them as strings.

Once created, factors can only contain a pre-defined set of values, known as
*levels*. By default, R always sorts levels in alphabetical order. For
instance, if you have a factor with 2 levels:


~~~
respondent_floor_type <- factor(c("earth", "cement", "cement", "earth"))
~~~
{: .language-r}

R will assign `1` to the level `"cement"` and `2` to the level `"earth"`
(because `c` comes before `e`, even though the first element in this vector is
`"earth"`). You can see this by using the function `levels()` and you can find
the number of levels using `nlevels()`:


~~~
levels(respondent_floor_type)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "cement" "earth" 
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
nlevels(respondent_floor_type)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 2
~~~
{: .output}

Sometimes, the order of the factors does not matter. Other times you might want
to specify the order because it is meaningful (e.g., "low", "medium", "high").
It may improve your visualization, or it may be required by a particular type of
analysis. Here, one way to reorder our levels in the `respondent_floor_type`
vector would be:


~~~
respondent_floor_type # current order
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] earth  cement cement earth 
Levels: cement earth
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
respondent_floor_type <- factor(respondent_floor_type, 
                                levels = c("earth", "cement"))

respondent_floor_type # after re-ordering
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] earth  cement cement earth 
Levels: earth cement
~~~
{: .output}

In R's memory, these factors are represented by integers (1, 2), but are more
informative than integers because factors are self describing: `"cement"`,
`"earth"` is more descriptive than `1`, and `2`. Which one is "earth"? You
wouldn't be able to tell just from the integer data. Factors, on the other hand,
have this information built in. It is particularly helpful when there are many
levels. It also makes renaming levels easier. Let's say we made a mistake and
need to recode "cement" to "brick".


~~~
levels(respondent_floor_type)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "earth"  "cement"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
levels(respondent_floor_type)[2] <- "brick"

levels(respondent_floor_type)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "earth" "brick"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
respondent_floor_type
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] earth brick brick earth
Levels: earth brick
~~~
{: .output}

So far, your factor is unordered, like a nominal variable. R does not know the
difference between a nominal and an ordinal variable. You make your factor an
ordered factor by using the `ordered=TRUE` option inside your factor function.
Note how the reported levels changed from the unordered factor above to the
ordered version below. Ordered levels use the less than sign `<` to denote
level ranking.


~~~
respondent_floor_type_ordered <- factor(respondent_floor_type, 
                                        ordered = TRUE)

respondent_floor_type_ordered # after setting as ordered factor
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] earth brick brick earth
Levels: earth < brick
~~~
{: .output}


### Converting factors

If you need to convert a factor to a character vector, you use
`as.character(x)`.


~~~
as.character(respondent_floor_type)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "earth" "brick" "brick" "earth"
~~~
{: .output}

Converting factors where the levels appear as numbers (such as concentration
levels, or years) to a numeric vector is a little trickier. The `as.numeric()`
function returns the index values of the factor, not its levels, so it will
result in an entirely new (and unwanted in this case) set of numbers.
One method to avoid this is to convert factors to characters, and then to
numbers. Another method is to use the `levels()` function. Compare:


~~~
year_fct <- factor(c(1990, 1983, 1977, 1998, 1990))

as.numeric(year_fct)                     # Wrong! And there is no warning...
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 3 2 1 4 3
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
as.numeric(as.character(year_fct))       # Works...
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 1990 1983 1977 1998 1990
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
as.numeric(levels(year_fct))[year_fct]   # The recommended way.
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 1990 1983 1977 1998 1990
~~~
{: .output}

Notice that in the recommended `levels()` approach, three important steps occur:

* We obtain all the factor levels using `levels(year_fct)`
* We convert these levels to numeric values using `as.numeric(levels(year_fct))`
* We then access these numeric values using the underlying integers of the
vector `year_fct` inside the square brackets

### Renaming factors

When your data is stored as a factor, you can use the `plot()` function to get a
quick glance at the number of observations represented by each factor level.
Let's extract the `memb_assoc` column from our data frame, convert it into a
factor, and use it to look at the number of interview respondents who were or
were not members of an irrigation association:


~~~
## create a vector from the data frame column "memb_assoc"
memb_assoc <- interviews$memb_assoc

## convert it into a factor
memb_assoc <- as.factor(memb_assoc)

## let's see what it looks like
memb_assoc
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~

Looking at the plot compared to the output of the vector, we can see that in
addition to "no"s and "yes"s, there are some respondents for which the
information about whether they were part of an irrigation association hasn't
been recorded, and encoded as missing data. They do not appear on the plot.
Let's encode them differently so they can counted and visualized in our plot.



~~~
## Let's recreate the vector from the data frame column "memb_assoc"
memb_assoc <- interviews$memb_assoc

## replace the missing data with "undetermined"
memb_assoc[is.na(memb_assoc)] <- "undetermined"

## convert it into a factor
memb_assoc <- as.factor(memb_assoc)

## Formatting Dates

One of the most common issues that new (and experienced!) R users have is
converting date and time information into a variable that is appropriate and
usable during analyses. As a reminder from earlier in this lesson, the best
practice for dealing with date data is to ensure that each component of your
date is stored as a separate variable. In our dataset, we have a
column `interview_date` which contains information about the
year, month, and day that the interview was conducted. Let's
convert those dates into three separate columns.


~~~
str(interviews)
~~~
{: .language-r}
We are going to use the package **`lubridate`**, which is included in the
**`tidyverse`** installation but not loaded by default, so we have to load
it explicitly with `library(lubridate)`.

Start by loading the required package:


~~~
library(lubridate)
~~~
{: .language-r}

The lubridate function `ymd()` takes a vector representing year, month, and day,
and converts it to a `Date` vector. `Date` is a class of data recognized by R as
being a date and can be manipulated as such. The argument that the function
requires is flexible, but, as a best practice, is a character vector formatted
as "YYYY-MM-DD".

Let's extract our `interview_date` column and inspect the structure:


~~~
dates <- interviews$interview_date
str(dates)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 POSIXct[1:131], format: "2016-11-17" "2016-11-17" "2016-11-17" "2016-11-17" "2016-11-17" ...
~~~
{: .output}

When we imported the data in R, `read_csv()` recognized that this column
contained date information. We can now use the `day()`, `month()` and  `year()`
functions to extract this information from the date, and create new columns in
our data frame to store it:



~~~
interviews$day <- day(dates)
interviews$month <- month(dates)
interviews$year <- year(dates)
interviews
~~~
{: .language-r}

{: .output}

Notice the three new columns at the end of our data frame.

In our example above, the `interview_date` column was read in correctly as a
`Date` variable but generally that is not the case. Date columns are often read
in as `character` variables and one can use the `as_date()` function to convert
them to the appropriate `Date/POSIXct`format.

Let's say we have a vector of dates in character format:


~~~
char_dates <- c("7/31/2012", "8/9/2014", "4/30/2016")
str(char_dates)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 chr [1:3] "7/31/2012" "8/9/2014" "4/30/2016"
~~~
{: .output}

We can convert this vector to dates as :


~~~
as_date(char_dates, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "2012-07-31" "2014-08-09" "2016-04-30"
~~~
{: .output}

Argument `format` tells the function the order to parse the characters and
identify the month, day and year. The format above is the equivalent of 
mm/dd/yyyy. A wrong format can lead to parsing errors or incorrect results.

For example, observe what happens when we use a lower case y instead of upper
case Y for the year. 

~~~
as_date(char_dates, format = "%m/%d/%y")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "2020-07-31" "2020-08-09" "2020-04-30"
~~~
{: .output}

Here, the `%y` part of the format stands for a two-digit year instead of a
four-digit year, and this leads to parsing errors.

Or in the following example, observe what happens when the month and day
elements of the format are switched.


~~~
as_date(char_dates, format = "%d/%m/%y")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] NA           "2020-09-08" NA          
~~~
{: .output}

Since there is no month numbered 30 or 31, the first and third dates cannot be
parsed.

We can also use functions `ymd()`, `mdy()` or `dmy()` to convert character
variables to date.


~~~
mdy(char_dates)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "2012-07-31" "2014-08-09" "2016-04-30"

# Wrangling data with dplyr

dplyr is a package that makes wrangling data easier.

We wrangle data when we select, filter and summarise data.


The pipe construct makes it easy to string together different
manipulations of the data:

~~~
data %>% filter(some logical test on a column)
~~~
{: .language-r}

We select a set of columns by using the select function:


~~~
interviews %>% select(village, memb_assoc)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 131 × 2
   village  memb_assoc
   <chr>    <chr>

 8 Chirodzo yes       
 9 Chirodzo no        
10 Chirodzo no        
# … with 121 more rows
