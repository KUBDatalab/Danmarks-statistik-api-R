## What is an API?

An API is an Application Programming Interface. It is a way of making
applications, in our case an R-script, able to communicate with another
application, here the Statistics Denmark databases.

Talking about APIs, we talk about several different things. It can be
quite confusing, but dont worry!

What we want to be able to do, is to let our own application, our
R-script, send a command to a remote application, the databases of
Statistics Denmark, in order to retrieve specific data.

This is equivalent to requesting a page from a webserver.

The HTTP protocol can be visualized like this:

![](images/http-structure.png)

-   When we type in an URL in our browser, it translates that URL to a
    HTTP-request.

-   The browser sends that HTTP-request to a webserver. The request
    contains information about the page we need, but in the "header" of
    the request, there is a lot of other information. The version of
    browser we are using and cookies to just mention two.

-   The webserver interpret the request, and retrieves the data.

-   After that, the webserver sends both the status of the request
    (hopefully 200 - which is short for "everything is OK"), and the
    data.

-   The browser receives the data, and displays it as a webpage.

When we are working with APIs we cut out the user. We have a script that
needs some data. We write code that defines, and then send a request til
a server, specifying which data we need. The server extracts the needed
data, and returns it to the script.

So - how do we do that?

Looking closer at the illustration above, we can see that we send a
GET-request to the server. But we are not only asking for at simple
page, we need to specify some more information. And then we have to use
a slightly different request to the server, a POST-request.

With a POST-request we can control what data is send along with the
request, and the data returned by the server depends on what data we
send.

We are going to write a POST-request (with a little help from R), to retrieve
data from Statistics Denmark.

But before we can do that, we need to know how the SD-API expects to receive 
data.

Hopefully we can get that by reading the documentation. We can find that here:

https://www.dst.dk/en/Statistik/brug-statistikken/muligheder-i-statistikbanken/api

That was confusing!


Three main things:

Statistics Denmark provides four "functions", or "endpoints":

Billede funktion

The first is the "web"-site we have to send requests to if we want information 
on the subjects in Statistics Denmark.

When we finally need the data, we will visit the last endpoint.




After installation, we load the library using the library function. And
then we can access the functions included in the library:

The get_subjects() function sends a request to the Statistics Denmark
API, asking for a list of the subjects. The information is returned to
our script, and the get_subjects() function presents us with a dataframe
containing the information.

```{r get-subjects}
library(danstat)
subjects <- get_subjects()
subjects
```

We get the 13 major subjects from Statistics Denmark. Each of them have
sub-subjects.

If we want to take a closer look at the subdivisions of a given subject,
we use the get_subjects() function again, this time specifying which
subject we are interested in:

Let us try to get the sub-subjects from the subject 1 - containing
information about populations and elections:

```{r get-sub-subjects}
sub_subjects <- get_subjects(subjects = 1)
sub_subjects
```

The result is a bit complicated. The column "subjects" in the resulting
dataframe contains another dataframe. We access it like we normally
would access a column in a dataframe:

```{r show-sub-sub-subjects}
sub_subjects$subjects
```

Those sub-subjects have their own subjects! Lets get to the bottom of
this, and use 2401, Population and population projections as an example:

```{r}
sub_sub_subjects <- get_subjects("3401")
sub_sub_subjects$subjects
```

Now we are at the bottom. We can see in the column "hasSubjects" that
there are no sub_sub_sub_subjects.

The hierarchy is: 1 Population and elections \| 3401 Population \| 20021
Population figures

The final sub_sub_subject contains a number of tables, that actually
contains the data we are looking for.

get_subjects is able to retrieve all the sub, sub-sub and
sub-sub-sub-jects in one go. The result is a bit confusing and difficult
to navigate.

Remember that the initial result was a dataframe containing another
dataframe. If we go all the way to the bottom, we will get a dataframe,
containing several dataframes, each of those containing several
dataframes.

We recommend that you do not try it, but this is how it is done:

```{r}
lots_of_subjects <- get_subjects(1, recursive = T, include_tables = T)
```

The "recursive = T" parameter means that get_subjects will retrieve the
subjects of the subjects, and then the subjects of those subjects.

## Which datatables exists?

But we ended up with a sub_sub_subject,

20021 Population figures

How do we find out which tables exists in this subject?

The get_tables() function returns a dataframe with information about the
tables available for a given subject.

```{r get-tables}
tables <- get_tables(subjects="20021")
tables
```

We get at lot of information here. The id identifies the table, text
gives a description of the table that humans can understand. When the
table was last updated and the first and last period that the table
contains data for.

In the variables column, we get information on what kind of data is
stored in the table.

Before we pull out the data, we need to know which variables are
available in the table. We do this with this function:

```{r get-metadata}
metadata <- get_table_metadata("FOLK1A", variables_only = T)
metadata
```

There is a lot of other metadata in the tables, including the phone
number to the staffmember at Statistics Denmark that is responsible for
maintaining the table. We are only interested in the variables, which is
why we add the parameter "variables_only = T".

What kind of values can the individual datapoints take?

```{r get-values}
metadata %>% slice(4) %>% pull(values)
```

We use the slice function from tidyverse to pull out the fourth row of
the dataframe, and the pull-function to pull out the values in the
values column.

The same trick can be done for the other fields in the table:

```{r}
metadata %>% slice(1) %>% pull(values) %>% .[[1]] %>% head
```

Here we see the individual municipalities in Denmark.

Now we are almost ready to pull out the actual data!

But first!

## Which variables do we want?

We need to specify which variables we want in our answer. Do we want the
total population for all municipalities in Denmark? Or just a few? Do we
want the total population, or do we want it broken down by sex.

These variables, and the values of them, need to be specified when we
pull the data from Statistics Denmark.

We also need to provide that information in a specific way.

If we want data for all municipalites, we want to pull the variable
"OMRÅDE" from the list of variables.

Therefore we need to give the function an argument containing both the
information that we want the population data broken down by "OMRÅDE",
and that we want all values of "OMRÅDE".

Vectors are characterized by only being able to contain one type of
data.

When we need to have structures that can contain more than one type of
data, we can use the list structure.

Lists allows us to have values, with names (sometime descriptive).

Lists can even contain lists.

And that is what we need here. Let us make our first list:

```{r}
list(code = "OMRÅDE", values = NA)
```

This list have to components. One called "code", and one called
"values". Code have the content "OMRÅDE", specifying that we want the
variable in the data from Statistics Denmark calld "OMRÅDE".

"values" has the content "NA". We use "NA", when we want to specify that
we want all the "OMRÅDE". If we only wanted a specific municipality, we
could instead specify it instead of writing "NA".

Let us assume that we also want to break down the data based on marriage
status.

That information is stored in the variable "CIVILSTAND".

And above, we saw that we had the following values in that variable:

```{r}
metadata %>% slice(4) %>% pull(values)
```

A value for the total population is probably not that interesting, if we
pull all the individual values for "Never married" etc.

We can now make another list:

```{r}
  list(code = "CIVILSTAND", values = c("U", "G", "E", "F"))
```

Here the "values" part is a vector containing the values we want to pull
out for that variable.

It might be interesting to take a look at how the population changes
over time.

In that case we need to pull out data from the "Tid" variable.

That would look like this:

```{r}
list(code = "Tid", values = NA)
```

If we want to pull data broken down by all three variables, we need to
provide a list, containing three lists.

We do that using this code:

```{r}
variables <- list(list(code = "OMRÅDE", values = NA),
                  list(code = "CIVILSTAND", values = c("U", "G", "E", "F")),
                  list(code = "Tid", values = NA)
              )
variables
```

And now, finally, we are ready to get the data!

```{r}
data <- get_data(table_id = "FOLK1A", variables = variables)
```

It takes a short moment. But now we have a dataframe containing the data
we requested:

```{r}
head(data)
```

This procedure will work for all the tables from Statistics Denmark!

The data is nicely formatted and ready to use. Almost.

Before we do anything else, let us save the data.

```{r}
write_csv2(data, "../data/SD_data.csv")
```
